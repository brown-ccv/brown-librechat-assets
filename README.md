# brown-librechat-assest

This small repository helps us override specific assets from the (librechat)[https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat]  project to customize our deployment by replacing labels and images.
The Dockerfile contains all the instructions to clone the official LibreChat repository, apply our custom content, and build a new image with the changes.
